    "# Now You Code In-Class: Boxes Of Flooring\n",
    "\n",
    "High's Home Improvement has hired you to write a mobile app which will estimate the number of boxes of laminate flooring required to cover a room. \n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One box of flooring covers 24.5 square feet. \n",
    "- You should account for 10% waste in any project. This means you should buy 10% more flooring than you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a python program which given the length and width measurement of a room will correctly calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area of the room in square feet\n",
    "- The project area when accounting for 10% waste\n",
    "- The number of boxes of flooring required, rounded up to the nearest whole box. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "*** Boxes of Flooring ***\n",
    "Length of room (ft): 3\n",
    "Width of room (ft): 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations....\n",
    "Room Area: ==> 18.0 square ft\n",
    "Project Area: 18.0 square ft + 1.8 (10% waste) ==> 19.8 square ft\n",
    "Number of boxes at 24.5 square ft: ==> 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Use string formatters or f-strings to display the output to 1 decimal place.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Round up your boxes of flooring to the nearest whole box. `math.ciel()`\n"
